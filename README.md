# R-Project-Wine_Quality_Class
The data for this exercise comes from wine industry. Each record represents a sample of a specific wine product, the input attributes include its organoleptic characteristics, and the output denotes the quality class of each wine: {high, low}. The labels have been assigned by human wine tasting experts, and we can treat that information as “ground truth” in this exercise. Your job is to build the best model to predict wine quality from its characteristics, so that the winery could replace costly services of professional sommeliers with your automated alternative, to enable quick and effective quality tracking of their wines at production facilities. They need to know whether such change is feasible, and what extents of inaccuracies may be involved in using your tool.

This project only contains one .R file.

Thanks,
Martin
